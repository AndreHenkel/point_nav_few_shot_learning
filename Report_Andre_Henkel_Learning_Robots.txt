Title: Reproduction study on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks in Reinforcement Learning


Current status: Completed the architecture and the setup except the Agent environment.

Architecture modules: Controller, Agent, Model, Sampler

Next steps: Implement the environment and start gathering "Agent experience" to train the network.


Task: I will reproduce the 2D navigation agent mentioned in the MAML paper. The task is navigating the agent from point A to point B. The observation is only the current position of the agent, the actions correspond to velocity commands. And the reward is the negative squared distance to the goal position.

The tasks for the meta learning will differ in the position of the goal destination for training and testing.


The paper also mentioned comparable approaches, which I will reproduce if there's enough time at the end.
